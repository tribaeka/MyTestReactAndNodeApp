We do a lot of things, so it's hard to explain it all in a single paragraph, but our mission is to empower independent creators.

We have offices in NYC and Denver, but more than 50% of the team is remote, in exotic locations like the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Ohio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we're distributed and because most of our tasks aren't immediately time-sensitive we don't really have operating hours, per se. There are things to do and meetings to be had, but we pride ourselves on our flexibility. We think this makes Standard a great place to work for people with families, or whose productive hours tend to be outside of the 9-5.

We work in the online education space, so we understand how much can be learned on your own, on the Internet, outside of a classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe're looking for people who are curious and passionate. Our team should be made up of people of all sorts of colors, genders, and sizes, who can help to expand our perspective and improve our ability to treat our creators and our audience with thoughtfulness and empathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that sounds like you, we're happy to care less how many years of experience you have or where you went to school. Apply anyway. And if you have any feedback on how we could reach or appeal to a more diverse pool of talent, get in touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
